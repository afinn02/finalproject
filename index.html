            <p> 
            We call ourselves the Finnucci family which is a combination of our Irish and Italian last names (Finn & Iannucci).
            We are Michigan natives from the Detroit metropolitan area as well as a house-divided. Our family is comprised of four members: Sandra Iannucci, Thomas Finn,
            Arianna Finn, and Abigail Finn (that's me!). This past summer of 2022 we had some interesting adventures in Iceland and Utah. Continue reading

                        went to high school at Brother Rice where he played football and ran track. He still has multiple athletic records there that stand

                    mostly deaf, as she has dealt with progressive hearing loss her entire life. She got her first pair of hearing aids at the age of 15
                    before all of our grandparents. She is an acceptional athlete that ran the 400 in track, played soccer and swam.
